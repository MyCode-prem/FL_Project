Introduction: 

 Federated Learning (FL) is a cool way for computers to learn together without sharing their private data. In this guide, we'll show you how to use FL with a basic learning method called Linear Regression. It's like drawing a line through points on a graph.
We'll use two computers (called "clients") and one main computer (an "aggregation server") to do this. And we'll do it all using Google Colab, a tool for working on projects together online.
Our goal is to walk you through each step, sharing bits of code and explaining what they do. We'll also talk about why this is useful, how well it works, and what challenges we might face.
ML Models: 
Machine learning models we have used in the project are :
1.Linear Regression
2.Lasso Regression
3.KNN
We have further thoughts of implementing Logistic regression and Ridge Regression.
